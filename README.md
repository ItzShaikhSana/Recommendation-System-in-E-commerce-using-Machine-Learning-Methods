Data Collection 
* Installing & Importing All Libraries
* Dataset Loading : loading data from json file to

I. Text Cleaning : cleaning text using nltk.
II. Text Preprocessing: tfidf vectorizer, converting 
categorical to number.
III. Labelling Data using Vader Sentiment Analyzer
IV. Sentiment Analysis Visualization: WordCloud, 
CountPlot
V. Splitting Dataset into Train and Test.
VI. Model Training: AdaBoostClf, RandomForestClf.
VII. Model Evaluation: Confusion Matrix, Classification 
Report.
* Phase 2 (Recommendation)
I. Popularity Based Recommendation of Top 50
